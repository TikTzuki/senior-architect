# Pre-Deployment Checklist — Base (Web & Mobile)

Language-agnostic, framework-agnostic. Run this before **every** production deploy. Security is the deepest section on
purpose — do not skip it.

> This is the **base** checklist — it applies to any stack. A stack checklist (`go.md`, `java.md`, …) dropped
> in this same directory *extends* this file; it never replaces it. Run the base first, then any stack file
> that matches the project. Copy [_template.md](./_template.md) to start one.

## How to use (humans)

1. Copy this file (or the relevant sections) per release.
2. Tick each `- [ ]` box. A `[BLOCKER]` left unchecked = **no deploy**.
3. Fill the **Sign-off** block at the end. Get a second person to approve when possible.

## How to use (AI agents)

Do not paste this file into a prompt. Run `/deploy-checklist` — [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) carries the audit
procedure, the evidence rule, and the PASS/FAIL/N-A output contract. This file stays the source of truth
for *what* to check; the skill governs *how* it is checked.

**Severity legend**

| Mark        | Meaning                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `[BLOCKER]` | Do not deploy until fixed                 |
| `[SHOULD]`  | Deploy only with a tracked ticket + owner |
| `[NICE]`    | Improve when time allows                  |

## 1. Shared / Universal (Web + Mobile)

### Build & release

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Build is reproducible from a clean checkout (no local-only files, no uncommitted state)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Version / build number bumped and tagged in version control
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Changelog / release notes updated
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Rollback plan written and tested (know how to revert in < 5 min)
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Feature flags for new work default to **off**; toggles documented
- [ ] `[NICE]` Build artifacts are stored/archived for the release tag

### Config & secrets

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` No secrets, API keys, tokens, or credentials committed to the repo (check history, not just HEAD)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Environment-specific config separated (dev / staging / prod); prod config not reachable from dev
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` `.gitignore` (or equivalent) covers key files, `.env`, certificates, keystores
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Secret rotation policy exists; long-lived secrets flagged for rotation
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Third-party keys are scoped to least privilege (read-only where possible)

### Auth & sessions

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Session / access tokens have a sane expiry
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Refresh flow works and revokes old tokens
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Logout invalidates the session server-side (not just client-side)
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Password policy + login rate-limit / lockout in place
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Account recovery flow reviewed (no user enumeration, no insecure reset links)

### Data & privacy

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` All data encrypted in transit (TLS everywhere)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` PII minimized — collect only what is needed
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Backups exist **and a restore has been tested** (a backup you can't restore is not a backup)
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Data deletion path works (user delete removes real data, not just a flag)

### Observability

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Logs contain **no** secrets, tokens, or PII
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Error tracking wired up (crash / exception reporting)
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Alerting on error-rate spikes and downtime
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Health check / readiness endpoint or heartbeat exists

### Testing & QA

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Unit + integration tests pass in CI
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` End-to-end / critical-path tests pass
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Smoke test on staging with production-like config

- [ ] `[SHOULD]` License compliance checked for shipped dependencies

---

## 2. Web-Specific

### Security headers

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` `Content-Security-Policy` set and restrictive (no blanket `unsafe-inline` on scripts)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) enabled
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` `X-Frame-Options` / `frame-ancestors` set (clickjacking)
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` `Referrer-Policy` set

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` All `http://` redirects to `https://`
- [ ] `[NICE]` HSTS preload considered for the apex domain

### Cross-origin & cookies

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` CORS locked to known origins (no `*` on authenticated endpoints)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Session cookies are `HttpOnly` + `Secure` + `SameSite`

### Input / output

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` All input validated server-side (client validation is UX only, not security)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Output encoded / escaped to prevent XSS
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` CSRF protection on state-changing requests

- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Source maps not exposing internal source in prod (or access-restricted)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Debug endpoints / admin routes not reachable in prod

### Pre-deploy hygiene (non-security)

- [ ] `[SHOULD]` `robots.txt`, sitemap, canonical URLs correct
- [ ] `[NICE]` Performance budget / Lighthouse pass
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Accessibility (a11y) pass on key pages
- [ ] `[NICE]` Custom 404 / 500 pages don't leak stack traces

---

## 3. Mobile-Specific

> Applies to any platform or framework (native iOS/Android, cross-platform, hybrid). Items are stated by intent, not by
> tool. Tool names below are examples only.

### Store readiness

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` App correctly signed (release signing keys/certs/provisioning, not debug)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` App ID / bundle identifier matches the store listing
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Version name + build number incremented
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Store listing complete (description, screenshots, category, contact)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Privacy disclosure filled (data-safety / privacy nutrition label) and matches actual data use

### Permissions

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Request only the permissions actually used
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Each permission has a clear user-facing justification string
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Runtime permission prompts handled; app degrades gracefully when denied

### Secure storage

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Secrets / tokens stored in platform secure storage (Keychain / Keystore), never plaintext files or
  shared prefs
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` No secrets, private keys, or backend admin creds hardcoded in the binary (the binary ships to the
  user's device and can be reverse-engineered)

### Network

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` TLS only; cleartext / plain-HTTP traffic disabled
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Certificate pinning where the threat model warrants it
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` API keys embedded in the app are treated as public (scope them; enforce auth server-side)

### Anti-tampering & release hygiene

- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Root / jailbreak awareness for sensitive flows (payments, auth)
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Sensitive logic obfuscated / minified in release build
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Debug logging, verbose logs, and dev tooling disabled in the release build

### Offline & data

- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Local cache / database encrypted if it holds sensitive data
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Local data wiped on logout
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` Deep links / URL schemes validated (reject untrusted params, no auth bypass via link)

### Update & recovery

- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Over-the-air / update path tested
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Force-update mechanism for a broken/insecure old version
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Crash reporting enabled (without leaking PII)

---

## 4. Security — Audit-Grade

This is the deep section. Treat it as its own gate.

### 4.1 Threat model quickstart

- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` **Assets** listed — what an attacker wants (user data, credentials, money, uptime, reputation)
- [ ] `[BLOCKER]` **Entry points** listed — every place input crosses into the system (APIs, forms, file upload,
  webhooks, deep links, third-party callbacks)
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` **Trust boundaries** drawn — where does untrusted become trusted? (client to server, service to
  service, tenant to tenant)
- [ ] `[SHOULD]` **STRIDE** pass — for each entry point, ask:
    - Spoofing — can identity be faked?
    - Tampering — can data be altered in transit / at rest?
    - Repudiation — can an action be denied? (is it logged?)
    - Information disclosure — can data leak?
    - Denial of service — can it be overwhelmed?
    - Elevation of privilege — can a user gain rights they shouldn't have?

- [ ] `[SHOULD]` Multi-tenant isolation verified (tenant A cannot read tenant B)

### 4.5 Secrets & key management

> Rule: **zero unresolved `[BLOCKER]`.** Every `[SHOULD]` shipping open must have an owner and a ticket.
